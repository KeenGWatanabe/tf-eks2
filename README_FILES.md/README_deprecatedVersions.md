To check for version updates and stay informed about Kubernetes version deprecations, you should refer to the following sources:

### 1. **Official Kubernetes Documentation & Release Notes**  
   - [Kubernetes Release Notes](https://kubernetes.io/releases/)  
   - [Kubernetes Version Skew Policy](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/)  
   - These documents detail supported versions, deprecation timelines, and upgrade paths.

### 2. **Your Cloud Provider's Documentation**  
   Since you're receiving a deprecation notice from your cloud provider (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS), check their specific documentation:  
   - **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):**  
     - [GKE Release Schedule](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-schedule)  
     - [GKE Upgrade Guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/upgrading-a-cluster)  
   - **Amazon EKS:**  
     - [EKS Kubernetes Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html)  
   - **Azure AKS:**  
     - [AKS Supported Kubernetes Versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions)  

### 3. **Cluster Dashboard & Notifications**  
   - Cloud providers (like GCP, AWS, Azure) usually send deprecation alerts via:  
     - **Email notifications** (registered account email)  
     - **Cloud Console alerts** (e.g., GCP's "Recommendations" or AWS's "Personal Health Dashboard")  
   - Check your cluster's dashboard for upgrade prompts.

### 4. **Extended Support & Pricing**  
   - If your cluster enters **extended support** (after Nov 26, 2025, for v1.31), review the pricing implications:  
     - [GKE Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing)  
     - [EKS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/)  
     - [AKS Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/)  

### **Action Steps:**  
1. **Upgrade Before Nov 26, 2025** to avoid extended support fees.  
2. Test upgrades in a non-production cluster first.  
3. Follow your provider’s recommended upgrade path (e.g., GKE’s `gcloud container clusters upgrade`).
